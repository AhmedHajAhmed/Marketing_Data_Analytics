# Marketing_Data_Analytics

### Goals 

This notebook contains an analysis on some marketing data. The goals for this project are the following:
* Get acquainted with the data
* Clean and prepare the data for analysis
* Develop some questions for analysis
* Analyze variables within the data to gain patterns and insights on these questions

Information regarding the features for the data are [here](https://github.com/AhmedHajAhmed/Marketing_Data_Analytics/blob/main/feature_descriptions).


### Conclusion 

It has been shown that `income` has the strongest relationship with purchase behavior of customers. However, interesting insights about `education` and `age` along with `age_group` have been noted. Such insights might be very helpful to show how this store markets deals to their customers and prices items, such as wine sales. There is also opportunity to increase market to the `18 to 35` and `71 and Older` age groups to drive products sales.
